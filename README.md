# Next.js Runtime Error with Unclear Error Message

This repository demonstrates a subtle runtime error in a Next.js application that results in a confusing error message.  The error is caused by a simple typo, but the error message itself doesn't accurately pinpoint the problem's source.

## Problem Description

The Next.js application consists of a home page and an about page. The about page contains a typographical error.  When navigating to the about page, a runtime error occurs, but the error message isn't helpful in identifying the exact location and nature of the problem.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the code for the About page component and correcting the typo.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the about page (`/about`).
5. Observe the runtime error that occurs.

## Lessons Learned

This example highlights the importance of:

*   Thorough code review.
*   Clear and informative error messages (though this is sometimes out of our control).
*   Debugging techniques to find and resolve errors effectively.
